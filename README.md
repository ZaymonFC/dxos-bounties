# DXOS Bounty Program

This repository collects the projects which are eligible for a bounty award from the DXOS team. 

These projects are important to the DXOS developer platform for decentralized, local-first, and privacy-preserving apps. The DXOS team will ensure that the projects are well-scoped and well-defined, and will provide close support and feedback as projects are delivered.

## How it works

Any given project becomes reserved for the first person who receives approval on a pull request with a design that is accepted by the team.

The bounty PR should have everything needed to complete the project, including a technical design, and a breakdown of "big chunks" and work items.

As the project is delivered, the bounty is paid out in parts corresponding to the agreed upon milestones in the plan.

To get started, pick one of the projects from the list and open a PR with your spec proposal in the corresponding `projects/<name>/` folder. The `README.md` will contain the request for proposal with an outline of the main problem to solve. Your proposal should live next to it.
